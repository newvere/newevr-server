    Now I find myself
  In the wild unknown
  With the frogs and toads
  And I'm far from home
  But there's so much here to discover
  One leap after another
  Hop into the adventure
  Gotta ribbit, ribbit
  Jump on in it
  Welcome to Amphibia life
  Don't get much crazier
  When you're a normal girl
  Living in another world
  What you gonna do?
  You gotta ribbit, ribbit
  Jump on in it
  Welcome to Amphibia life
  Don't get much crazier
  So ribbit, ribbit live it in
  Amphibia
  </p>
